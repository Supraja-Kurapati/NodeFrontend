Just 10 people here and there, putting out #Boycott Bollywood posts on social media doesn't make any sense anymore. It didn't even make any sense back in the day when it became a viral trend.

Take a look at some of the worst films of 2023 which not only failed to impress the audience but also did not do any magic at the box office Adipurush -This Prabhas, Saif Ali Khan, and Kriti Sanon starrer was an underwhelming take on the Indian epic Ramayan. Fans are still coping with the disastrous VFX. Selfiee- The movie was a remake of the 2019 Malayalam film Driving License. But the Akshay Kumar and Emraan Hashmi film failed to strike a chord with the audience.Kisi Ka Bhai Kisi Ki Jaan-  Even Bhaijaan‚Äôs swag failed to revive this poorly made movie by Farhad Samji. Shehzada- This Kartik Aaryan starrer made us wonder what was the need to remake the blockbuster Allu Arjun film Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo.  Dhak Dhak- We saw some better-executed women-led movies than this one which starred Ratna Pathak Shah, Fatima Sana Shaikh, Dia Mirza, and Sanjana Sanghi. Darran Chhoo - This Karan Patel and Ashutosh Rana starrer was a highly forgettable comedy flick.Mission Raniganj-  The Akshay Kumar starrer did not do a riveting subject like the Raniganj coal mine rescue mission justice.

But the dog seldom bites or barks, it only growls as soon as the doll takes a spring in her step, forcing her to recede to the shadows. Fairy tale gone wrong Sofia retains what Priscilla reiterates in her 1985 memoir Elvis and Me, that there was deep love between her and Elvis Presley. She meets him through a common acquaintance when she's 14 and he's 24. To her, Elvis symbolises the rebellion and freedom that's been kept away from her in the contained army upbringing. Like her parents, we fear her getting smitten by Elvis, but Sofia makes sure the story marches on with the combined force of fate and a young girl's agency. Priscilla is not taken in by Elvis' music or his larger-than-life personality. In fact, she's in love with his small gestures and giant sweeps in love, including him asking her parents to move her to his mansion at Graceland. With cinematographer Philippe Le Sourd's scrutinising lens and editor Sarah Flack's carefully crafted beats, Sofia builds what could be a fairy tale gone wrong. She fills the room with darkness in daylight."

Also producing is Kevin Walsh, who is currently in the awards season mix with Napoleon, as are the Nees via their banner Persons Attempting.The package hit Hollywood after Thanksgiving and attracted only a select group of buyers ‚Äî legacy studio Warners, and streaming goliaths Amazon and Netflix. The small pool of bidders was a result of the high-priced nature of the package. The actors were asking for a minimum of $20 million apiece, while the Nees were seeing paydays in the $6 million to $8 million range. With potential costs of $50 million or more out of the gate, the project was out of reach for most movie companies.According to sources, one offer came in at $175 million for the package, including above-the-line costs. The logline, according to sources, concerns a down-on-his-luck former Los Angeles detective turned private investigator who, after being shaken down by a vicious crime lord, must track down his estranged brother, who is responsible for interfering with a diamond heist.The project is not a go movie, however, as sources say the script needs a lot of work that one actor in particular may help oversee."

        description: " There‚Äôs a lot of information on whether one should eat refrigerated food or not. While there are a lot of claims which say that you shouldn‚Äôt eat refrigerated food. However, throwing away excess food isn‚Äôt a great option and eventually, you‚Äôll have to refrigerate them to prevent them from getting spoilt. So, what should you do? Read on as Dr. Saurabh Sethi, a Gastroenterologist sheds light on whether it is safe to eat refrigerated food.In a video shared on Instagram, Dr. Saurabh Sethi says, ‚ÄúThere are three myths about refrigerated food I will bust today.‚Äù He then goes on to speak about the myths and also shares facts. Dr. Sethi says, ‚ÄúMyth 1, leftover food equals food poisoning. This is not true. When stored and handled properly, most leftovers are safe to eat. Within two hours of cooking, store leftovers in airtight containers in the fridge.‚ÄùSpeaking of Myth 2, Dr. Sethi says, ‚ÄúLeftovers are forever. That is absolutely not true either. Leftovers have a shelf life. The general rule of thumb is to consume those within three to four days. After that, the risk of spoilage and foodborne illnesses increases.‚Äù While you can keep your leftovers in the fridge, make sure to eat them within a span of a few days. Don‚Äôt keep the food in the refrigerator for a long time and consuming it after so long might lead to food poisoning and other illnesses. About Myth 3, Dr. Sethi says, ‚ÄúReheating fixes everything. Not true! Reheating leftovers can kill some bacteria but it will not remove toxins produced by certain microbes. Make sure to consume your refrigerated food within 3 to 4 days.‚Äù While these facts are true, there are certain foods that you shouldn‚Äôt reheat because reheating increases certain compounds present in them which can eventually turn out to be toxic for the human body. Read on to know foods that you should avoid reheating. Spinach and celery, rich in nitrates, may convert to cancer-causing nitrosamines. Potatoes and rice may have bacteria leading to food poisoning. Seafood and fish are prone to spoilage, resulting in changes like dryness or odour. Fried foods like steak and eggs might change in texture, flavour and loss of nutrition when reheated.

        description: "Since Nigella Lawson called out Christmas cake as a festive food that should be forgotten (an opinion with which I wholeheartedly agree), I‚Äôve been thinking about re-evaluating our Christmas food choices. It‚Äôs time to accept that letting go of the festive traditions that no longer suit our appetites or our lifestyles is perfectly OK. Scaling back on the foods we don‚Äôt love means we can make room for the ones we do. If that means cooking a small air fryer roast this year, then great ‚Äì at least you won‚Äôt be lumbered with unwanted leftovers for a week after Christmas. My Instagram and TikTok feeds are offering me a sm√∂rg√•sbord of Christmas meal ideas ‚Äì some ridiculously indulgent and made entirely of flavoured butter; others more practical, such as big platters of all the sides with no main dish, an all-day breakfast, ‚Äúpicky bits‚Äù or buffet-style eating you can graze on all day. I now dream of potato grazing boards: wedges, chips, curly fries, waffle cuts, potato skins and crisps galore, tag-teamed with a dip-stravaganza.I can‚Äôt help but note that this communal style of eating is typical of many Asian dining norms, including those of my own Indian culture. Celebrations centre around food, and eating an array of dishes all at once. It‚Äôs a casual and sociable way of feasting that carries with it a sense of liberation and pleasure in helping yourself to more of what you love. At Christmas, my family goes for food that‚Äôs easy to prepare in bulk, since we‚Äôre a party of 40: Indo-east African channa bateta (a mix of potatoes and chickpeas cooked in coconut milk and topped with cassava crisps, chillies and raw mango chutney), or perhaps a selection of chaats, or dosa with different fillings (everything from classic potato to pizza or noodles), traybakes of multiple fajita fillings, meze and ‚Äì my favourite of all ‚Äì one huge biryani and a riot of different raitas.For now, I‚Äôve banished the Modha Christmas aubergine and introduced a new family tradition: an ugly delicious Christmas tree made entirely of samosas, complete with an aloo tikki star at the top. Any leftovers will go in the freezer for when the next craving hits, sometime in the new year. Then we‚Äôll have eaten it two years in a row ‚Äì which seems like the start of a new tradition. "

        description: "Enthusiastically promoted by authors like Charles Dickens and Washington Irving in the nineteenth century, Christmas celebrations were revived by the longing on the part of the Victorian middle class for an idealized past comprising familial sentiments and charitable thoughts towards those who were less fortunate.Food had always been an integral part of Christmas festivities. Certain dishes became associated with Christmas, sometimes because they had a symbolic meaning, and sometimes because they were too expensive to be eaten all the time. Pork was a favourite Christmas dish in Russia and Europe from Greece to Germany in the nineteenth century. It was one of the most favoured dishes in England too. The boar was sacrificed to the sun at Christmas as late as the early nineteenth century: a boar‚Äôs head formed part of a continuing ceremony since at least the fourteenth century held at The Queen‚Äôs College, Oxford. Pigs were an important source of meat from the Saxon period and remained so in the medieval period, probably representing the second most important source of meat after cattle. Pork, mutton, and beef were important foods not just because of their nutritional significance, but also because they could be smoked and salted, which preserved the produce for longer. Other parts of the animal were also used, stored or rendered for fats such as cheese and butter. Suckling pigs provided a tasty meal, but wild boar was appreciated as it was richer in flavour than domestic pork. Brawn was served with vinegar or syrup of wine and honey.British troops in Poona appreciated having pork for their Christmas dinner. That sold to the army was usually purchased at the canteens in barracks, for as a rule pork was never on sale in most of the native bazaars. Christmas was one occasion where the officers could hunt a wild boar.In the short story ‚ÄúJack Vereker‚Äôs Ghost‚Äù written by Sir Randal H Roberts in the late nineteenth century, the protagonist Albert Forrester, stationed at ‚ÄúGhoorpoorie lines‚Äù, Poona, during Christmas, is lounging in the verandah of the mess room, thinking of the jolly Christmas times he had spent at home ‚Äì the pheasant shooting, the hunting, the three woodcock he shot in the laurels the day before Christmas one year, the family dinner-party, the servants‚Äô ball, and the decoration of the church. He and his friends then decide to spend Christmas day hunting the wild boar near Poona."

From cutting-edge technologies to holistic lifestyle approaches, the year has witnessed a myriad of trends that have captured both attention and enthusiasm. The top health and fitness trends of this year reflect a harmonious blend of functional exercises, ancient wellness practices, and a collective desire for personalised, sustainable lifestyles. It's time to look back at the practices that have reshaped the way we approach our physical and mental well-being. Scroll down to check out the most popular trends that have not only sparked conversations but have also paved the way for a healthier and more vibrant future. 1. Gamified fitnessThe integration of gaming and fitness is evolving. Leading companies in the field are now offering cardiovascular exercise equipment that enhances the interactive gaming experience. Gamified fitness uses aspects of video games such as leaderboards, medals, points and awards to encourage and engage users. Fitness trackers are just one of the many gamified fitness applications and programmes available. They allow users to compete with friends and family and receive incentives for achieving goals. 2. Mini workouts Many people prefer to break up their exercise into shorter, more frequent sessions rather than devoting an hour to it. This could be split into three 15-minute sessions throughout the day, or short bursts of five to ten minutes. Many people find these shorter sessions easier to fit into their daily schedules, while others prefer to focus on one part of the body and take a few hours off before working that part again, rather than doing both at the same time and wearing out the second muscle group. 3. Biohacking The DIY biology technique known as 'biohacking', which aims to improve wellbeing, performance and health through deliberate intervention, has been popular in 2023. For example, nutrigenomics, a type of biohacking, focuses on the interactions between your unique genes and the food you eat. Through this type of biohacking, individuals seek to identify and maximise the ways in which different nutrients influence their thoughts, emotions and actions. 4. Functional fitness 5.

        description: "Start by setting simple and achievable goals for yourself In today‚Äôs fast-paced world, where the demands of modern life take precedence over physical and mental health needs, it is crucial to emphasise the significance of prioritising a healthy lifestyle. However, the journey towards a healthier life poses a challenge for millions of individuals worldwide, largely due to concerns related to weight and obesity. The issue of obesity is undoubtedly multifaceted, with genetic and lifestyle factors contributing to its complexity. A few ways which can help you to stay fit and lose weight are as below:Creating sustainable habits is the foundation for long-term success in weight management. Instead of chasing quick fixes, it is important that you prioritise health-conscious routines. Begin by adopting a balanced diet, incorporating regular physical activity, and mastering stress management. Keep in mind, that consistency is the secret to maintaining a healthy weight. Gradual lifestyle changes pave the way for lasting results. Incorporating a healthy diet is crucial for managing weight effectively. Incorporating a well-balanced diet while avoiding processed foods and sugary drinks is vital for weight maintenance. Essential minerals such as Zinc and Iron are crucial for antibody production and a strong immune system. For those struggling to maintain a nutritious diet due to a busy lifestyle, convenient on-the-go supplements such as Vestige Veslim Shake can be a practical solution. Prioritising adequate sleep is another crucial aspect of a successful weight-loss journey. Quality sleep plays a significant role in regulating hormones that control appetite and metabolism. Aim for 7-9 hours of restful sleep each night to support your weight management efforts. Poor sleep can lead to increased cravings for unhealthy foods and hinder your ability to make healthy choices during the day. Keeping a journal can be a powerful tool for tracking progress and staying accountable. One can use a variety of health monitoring apps to track daily food intake, exercise habits, and physical and mental wellness. This can help identify patterns, triggers for overeating, and areas where adjustments are needed. Parallelly, it also serves as a source of motivation when you can see the positive changes you've made over time."

        description: "Employees in various industries are accustomed to receiving bonuses based on their performance, with each company having its policies governing such rewards. However, recent changes to bonus policies have left employees at a Chinese company, The Dongpo Paper, in shock. According to a report from the South China Morning Post, The Dongpo Paper has shifted its performance bonus criteria from work habits to fitness, a move that has prompted employees to focus more on their physical well-being to secure bonuses. Situated in Guangdong Province, China, The Dongpo Paper Company recently implemented a notable alteration to its traditional performance bonus policy. Instead of assessing performance, the bonus is now determined by the fitness levels of employees. According to reports, employees will receive a full monthly bonus only if they run 50 kilometres within a month. Additional bonuses include a 60 per cent reward for running 40 kilometres, a 30 per cent bonus for a 30-kilometre run, and an extra 30 per cent for those achieving a 100-kilometre run in a month. Notably, the new policy extends beyond running, incorporating activities such as speed walking and mountain hiking. These activities can contribute 30 or 60 per cent of the total exercise tally and will be tracked through a dedicated app on employees‚Äô phones. As news of this policy went viral on social media, the company‚Äôs leadership clarified that the intention behind the change was to promote employee health. Employees have expressed contentment with the new approach, emphasising that it not only encourages fitness but also provides a financial incentive. In a separate development ahead of Diwali, the Indian government‚Äôs Finance Ministry made a significant decision regarding non-productivity-linked bonuses for central government employees in the fiscal year 2022‚Äì23. The Finance Ministry set the ceiling for computing a non-productivity-linked bonus (ad hoc bonus) at Rs 7,000. An office memorandum from the Department of Expenditure under the Finance Ministry stated that the non-productivity-linked bonus (ad hoc bonus) equivalent to 30 days of emoluments for the accounting year 2022‚Äì23 has been granted to central government employees in Group C. The bonus is also applicable to all non-gazetted employees in Group B who were not covered by any productivity-linked bonus scheme."

While many focus on fitness goals, a significant number struggle to maintain them beyond the first few months of the new year. However, when it comes to prioritizing health and fitness, there is no specific, Choose Realistic Fitness Resolutions: Individuals frequently set unrealistic fitness goals, which can be challenging to achieve. This may lead to demotivation and a reluctance to engage in regular workouts. Therefore, it is crucial to opt for an attainable goal that can be reached within a few months to maintain motivation and foster a positive fitness journey. Don't Wait Till the New Year: You don't need to wait until the end of the year to embark on a fitness journey. Start warming up and initiate your fitness routine before the year comes to a close. Find A Fitness Buddy: Exercising with a friend not only adds an element of fun but also serves as a source of motivation. Working out together allows for mutual support and encouragement, helping both individuals stay motivated and committed to their fitness journey. Plan in Advance: Establish your fitness goals between Christmas and New Year, rather than waiting until New Year's Eve. Use this time to plan by scheduling an appointment with a personal trainer or initiating a gym membership. Have a Plan B: Always have a backup plan in case of interruptions that prevent you from going to the gym or taking a walk. Explore home exercises to ensure you can stay active even in challenging situations. Add Some Variety to Your Workouts: Frequently changing your exercise routine can enhance enjoyment, maintain motivation, and significantly increase the likelihood of sticking to your fitness regimen.

Start Light ‚Äì Begin with lighter weights to master proper form and reduce the risk of injury. Focus on technique before increasing the load. 2. Learn Basic Movements ‚Äì Master fundamental exercises like squats, deadlifts, bench presses, and overhead presses. These compound movements engage multiple muscle groups for efficient workouts. 3. Prioritise Form ‚Äì Maintain proper posture, with attention to spine alignment and joint positioning. Good form is crucial for both effectiveness and injury prevention. 4. Controlled Movements ‚Äì Perform exercises with controlled, deliberate motions. Avoid rapid or jerky movements to engage muscles effectively and reduce the risk of strains. 5.

CHENNAI: It was the ‚Äúit moment‚Äù for most of the bodybuilders. A day that they had been looking forward to for a long time. When discipline and determination takes priority, for success, all you have to do is wait patiently. This was the message re-iterated by the enthusiastic participants at the Mr and Ms South India 2023 zonal bodybuilding and fitness championship presented by the World Fitness Federation (WFF) TamilNadu conducted on Sunday at Decathlon, Nolambur. Over the course of the last two decades, the competition organised by the WFF and World Fitness Association (WFA) has seen active participation. This year 300 enthusiastic participants from 21 diverse categories registered in the competition, comments Mohan Kumar, president of World Federation Association, Tamil Nadu. Participants from Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Puducherry, both men and women, came together to showcase their talents in Chennai. Mohan said, ‚ÄúDespite the challenges brought by the recent cyclone in the city, organising and executing significant large-scale competitions like this demanded a lot since participants arrived from all parts of south India. However, the notion of cancelling or postponing was never considered.‚Äù Mohan who was Mr South India in 2018 added that the participants‚Äô unwavering dedication and five to six months of training, should be appreciated. ‚ÄúThe commitment was to ensure that their efforts would not be in vain,‚Äù he said. He also emphasised the importance of fitness in our daily lives. He said, ‚ÄúBodybuilding helps to keep the body healthy, teaches discipline and also doesn‚Äôt promote unhealthy habits like smoking or drinking which could harm your potential and physique.‚Äù The event was the 9th competition organised by the Federation this year, and collaborated with One Tan and Viva Fitness. The New Indian Express was the media partner.  The WFF is a global bodybuilding organisation,with its headquarters situated in Australia.

        description: "The key components of a successful 21-day fitness routine would be to draft a doable plan, expect progressive success and realise that you don't have to stop living. Anything which fits well with your daily routine and time should be part of your 21-day routine. Be it exercise or diet. It is not a phase to go extreme but to go realistic with a lot of planning. How important is setting specific, achievable goals within a 21-day timeframe for someone looking to adopt a healthier lifestyle? The timeframe is not too long so it is important to set achievable goals. Don't expect big numbers on the scale. 3 weeks is a good way to adapt to a healthy lifestyle so think of it that way. It‚Äôs not enough to bring drastic changes but it is a great start to set a routine. Your routine needs to be sustainable. Try full-body workouts with strength training with 2-3kg dumbbells, kettlebells or resistance bands and focus on your shoulders, arms, chest, core, back, glutes, and legs. You can pick 2 exercises for each muscle group and stitch a routine around it. Walking to clock in 6,000 or 10,000 steps is a good way too. Moreover, cut off junk, alcohol, and sugar for healthier foods like vegetables, fruits and nuts.Often, people struggle with motivation when starting a new fitness routine. What advice do you have to keep individuals motivated and consistent throughout the 21 days? People struggle with motivation but you need to know that you just need to make a small goal and stick to it. Try to be in a circle of friends who are self-motivated or follow inspiring people. You can also start this challenge with your friends or loved ones to stay motivated. The biggest misconception is that something drastic will happen. Your body might respond differently and go through certain changes but don't set major expectations. Each body reacts differently to workouts and routine changes. What role does mental wellness play in achieving fitness goals within this 21-day timeframe, and how can individuals prioritise their mental health during this process? Wellness is holistic. It starts from what you're eating to what you‚Äôre thinking. Having a strong and positive mindset plays a huge role as well.How should individuals modify the routine to suit their needs and capabilities while staying true to the 21-day structure?"

What most people don‚Äôt know though, is that AI technology isn‚Äôt new, in fact it‚Äôs been around for years. It wasn‚Äôt until recently, programmers have discovered that if the average person can use AI technology to make money on their behalf, removing human error, the potential for profit is huge ‚Äì and that‚Äôs just what Bit GPT AI does automatically, even while you sleep. 3 biggest advantages of Bit GPT AI -By far, the biggest advantage of this application is because of artificial intelligence, there is minimal manual work required. It is currently only available in India, and the first users to register are already reporting earnings of at least $14,750 USD per month, well above the average for similar apps that have insane membership fees. Secondly, the app has a simple user interface, so no technical knowledge or experience is required to use it. The app comes with an algorithm that can independently determine which cryptocurrencies to buy and which to sell in order to maximize profits. Thirdly, withdrawals are fast (within 2 days of request) and reliable. Various payment methods are supported, such as cards, online accounts or bank transactions. To get started, you must deposit 20,000 Rupees or $250 in to your account balance so that the AI trading app can begin automatically buying and selling cryptocurrencies in order to generate profit. All transactions are carried out in a relatively short time, from a few minutes to several hours.The way the app determines which cryptocurrencies to buy and sell and at what time relies on the analysis of thousands of market indicators, from technical analysis of charts to world news that affect the movement of values. The real power of this app that sets it apart from others is an advanced AI algorithm that analyzes thousands of such signals every minute and is able to predict with extreme precision what to buy and sell at the right time to achieve maximum profit."

        category: "Technology",
        description: "Ever since it was launched in November 2022, OpenAI's ChatGPT has created an artificial intelligence frenzy that is still going strong. ChatGPT is the pioneer when it comes to generative AI chatbot technology, and with its Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT) foundational model, it can do pretty much anything a modern AI chatbot can. However, it is also one of the most general-purpose chatbots there is. If your use case requires you to go for something more nuanced or for a different capability, then these are the best ChatGPT alternatives that you should know about. The list includes Google Bard, Microsoft Copilot, and more.Best ChatGPT alternatives 1. Google Bard: Google Bard is based on the company's next-generation language and conversation capabilities powered by their Language Model for Dialogue Applications (LaMDA). Google Bard can generate a variety of responses, even from the same or similar prompts and questions. Once a user provides a prompt, Bard uses the context in the prompt and the interaction with the user to draft several versions of a response. The AI chatbot then classifies and checks its responses against predetermined safety parameters. If a user would like to see a different response or set of responses, they can ask Bard to generate a new response. Therefore, Google Bard should be used for creative collaborations, such as to generate a code for a program or give captions for photos. 2. Microsoft Copilot: Copilot, also known as Bing Chatbot, is a large language mode (LLM) chatbot developed by Microsoft. It is currently available in the Bing search engine and the Bing app. Like all chatbots, it can also answer most user queries and can generate text, draft emails, and more. It can also generate different creative text formats, like poems, code, scripts, musical pieces, letters, etc. Alongside, it can also help with unique tasks such as booking appointments, making travel arrangements, and shopping online.3. ChatSonic: ChatSonic is another conversational AI chatbot that takes advantage of the limitations of ChatGPT. Unlike OpenAI's generative AI model, ChatSonic can come up with up-to-date information with the ?Include Latest Google Data? option. Technologies such as GPT-4, Stable diffusion, DALL-E, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Machine Learning (ML) are incorporated in ChatSonic which allows the AI chatbot to accept prompts and generate responses."

Your phone is most likely listening to you, but the ears behind your phone are advertisers'. A review report by the Cox Media Group (CMG) reveals that the advertising company has the ability to tap into ambient conversations of users via built-in microphones in smartphones, smart TVs, and various gadgets to collect information and then employ that data for targeted advertising. As per the company, by 'Active Listening' advertisers like CMG get the information they need to pinpoint potential customers by analysing casual conversations in real-time. This was first reported by 404 Media.CMG has published a paper on its website on 'How Voice Data works and how you can use it in your business'. The introduction to the paper reads, 'What would it mean for your business if you could target potential clients who are actively discussing their need for your services in their day-to-day conversations? No, it's not a Black Mirror episode‚Äîit's Voice Data, and CMG has the capabilities to use it to your business advantage.'The paper further reads, 'That means a smart device is likely within earshot when we talk about our plans for the weekend, how badly we need our kitchen remodeled, or debate which SUV model is best‚Ä¶' Creepy? Sure. Great for marketing? Definitely,' the paper further reads. Yes, this is exactly what you are thinking about, because I am sure this has happened to you at least once before. A lot of times you are having a conversation (not on the phone) with a friend, say about buying a toaster, and minutes later when you pick up your phone and start surfing through social media, you start to see ads for toasters. This is when you have never actually searched for the said toaster before on your phone. All you have had is that conversation with your friend, and now you are seeing hoards of advertisements for it on different social media apps.   "

Since then, the agency said it had reviewed more than 900 crashes involving Autopilot. It found that Autopilot‚Äôs key Autosteer feature ‚Äúmay not‚Äù have sufficient controls to ‚Äúprevent driver misuse,‚Äù including using the feature outside the controlled-access highways for which it was designed.The notice said Tesla did not concur with the agency‚Äôs findings, though it began sending remote software updates on Tuesday, NHTSA said.

What‚Äôs new is how technologies like artificial intelligence and its powerful machine learning subset are beginning to transform businesses further. Being the CEO of a company that provides AI and automation solutions, I'm finding that technology-worker tensions are appearing at the start of the value chain with content creation and design, as well as on the edge, where users or customers interact with products and services.Workers Vs. AI - Beyond the more familiar fights related to money and distribution, earlier this year, striking Hollywood writers were also concerned about AI. The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers ultimately 'agreed to language protecting writers from the use of AI in the writing process, giving them credit for their work and allowing writers to determine if their writing can be used to train AI,' according to NPR."
